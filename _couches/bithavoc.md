I have a very confy and clean spare room in one of the most safe and fun areas of Medellin, Colombia.

Spare room includes:
* Bed with memory foam mattress and pillow
* 30/4MB WI-FI
* Studio with Desk and Chair
* Fully functional Kitchen and Washing Machine

Medellin one of the most beautiful and safe cities from Colombia with an increasingly growing entrepreneur and weather so awesome it has been nicknamed [The City of the Eternal Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn#Geography).  If you're a digital nomad and looking for a place to stay for a few days, drop me a message with your schedule and I'll let you know what's the availability of the spare room.
